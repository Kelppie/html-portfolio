<h1>The All Time Greatest Callum Movies</h1>
<h2>These Are Callum's Top 3 Films Ever! (Number 2 Will Shock You!)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1.Alien</h3>
<p>Goddamn it, that motherfucker Ridley Scott done did it. An amazing space thriller, Alien tells the story of the Nostromo and its crew, as the find themselves the victims of an extra-terrestrial life form; the perfect predator.</p>
<h3>2.The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Quite frankly, it is impossible to choose a favorite among Peter Jackson's masterful trilogy. As a whole, they may even be a greater work of fiction than <em>Alien</em>, but individually they are hard to compare.</p>
<h3>3. The Matrix</h3>
<p>This must have been a fluke. The Wachowskis somehow made something great by stealing ideas from indy comic books. Amazing and groundbreaking. 5 stars.</p>
